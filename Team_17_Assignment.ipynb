    "- Must read in a csv file containing a finite number of stock tickers (with an example csv file in this repo)\n",
    "- Portfolio must contain only US listed stocks\n",
    "- Must have an average daily volume of at least 10 000 shares as calculated based on the time interval July 2, 2021 to October 22, 2021\n",
    "- Pick a minimum 10 maximum 20 stocks for portfolio.\n",

    "- No individual stock may make up more than 35% of the portfolio when weighted by value\n",
    "- We have $100000 USD to spend on portfolio and all must be spent\n",

    "        - Price is the price on November 26, 2021\n",
    "        - Shares is the number of shares purchased (can be fractional)\n",
    "        - Value is the total value of those shares\n",
    "        - Weighted is the weight that the value of shares represents relative to the value of the portfolio (which is $100,000)\n",
    "    - Needs to show that the total adds up to $100,000\n",
    "    - Also need to show the weights add to 100%\n",
    "    - This DataFrame must be printed to the screen as the second to last output to the screen.\n",
    "- After the DataFrame, one final DataFrame called \"Stocks\" which has the same index as \"Final Portfolio\" must be made\n",
    "    - Only has the Tickers and Shares from \"Final Portfolio\"\n",
